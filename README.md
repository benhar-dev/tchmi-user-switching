## Overview
Super simple worked example of swapping users.  This function block requies parameters of the known username and password. This could be used as an alternative to Logout when you need to logout to a base "minimal" user level. 

### Example of quick user switching.

```javascript
(function (TcHmi) {

    var LoginUser = function (UserName,Password,StayLoggedIn,ReloadPage) {

        if (TcHmi.Server.isWebsocketReady()) {
            var request = {
                "requestType": "ReadWrite",
                "commands": [
                    {
                        "commandOptions": ["SendErrorMessage", "SendWriteValue"],
                        "symbol": "Login",
                        "writeValue":
                        {
                            "userName": UserName,
                            "password": Password,
